# Create React App public folder

When Create React App bundles your app, it includes all the files in this folder as-is.

The `/src` folder contains all styles and javascript, so this folder is primarily used for assets that need to be available
outside of the application bundle, eg. entry `index.html`, manifest assets, and Netlify redirects.
